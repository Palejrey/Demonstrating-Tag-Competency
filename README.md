# Demonstrating Tag Comprehension

## Description

My reasoning for creating the repository was to allow myself to demonstrate my comprehension of tags.
The intial file, in the Initial folder, contained alot of vauge div tags and this project seeks to rectify these div tags and make them more in line with accessibility standards using more appropriate tags.
Throughout the durtation of the creation of this project, I managed to make the concept of using approptiate tags a more concrete topic for myself.
